## Installation
1. Install [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) (or an alternatie driver for your browser of choice):
   * Run `brew cask install chromedriver`
   * Confirm installation: `chromedriver --version`
   * Check location of ChromeDriver: `which chromedriver`
   * Wherever the `driver` is initialized in the code, insert the ChromeDriver location
2. Install Selenium: `pip install selenium`
3. Install BeautifulSoup: `pip install beautifulsoup4`

## Usage
### To test `get_links.py`
1. Uncomment the last line `get_links.py`
2. Run `python get_links.py`

### To run the entire script:
1. Set a number of pages you'd like to iterate through here
2. Run `python apply.py`
3. The script will open [glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), at which point you should log-in
4. From there on, everything is automatic!

## TODO
